        <p class="second-text">Hi! My name's Will, and in this picture is my dog Zaia (who unfortunately can't go to college with me). I'm a guy who loves working on projects on the computer, listening to/composing/playing music, and enjoying the good in the world. I have a fair bit of programming experience through classes and coding projects I've done, including a Roblox game I worked on for a few years.</p>
